# ADDING A GOOGLE MAP TO YOUR WEBSITE

## Introduction

Adding a Google Map to your web page is very easy, once you've been shown how! That's what we're going to do in this lesson — we'll go over each step of creating a basic Google Map using the JavaScript API.

From there, it's only a matter of tweaking some of the options to customize the map to your liking; you can go even further by reading more of the [Maps API tutorials](/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/), 
or by reading the [Developer's Guide](/products-and-docs/apis/getting-started/).

## What you'll need

You don't need much to create a Google Maps API webpage:

### A text editor

Windows machines generally include Notepad; Mac OS X comes with TextEdit; Linux machines come with a variety of applications, including gedit, vim, or KWrite.

### A web browser

There are many well-known web browsers available for various platforms: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer are some of the best-known options.

Try it out:

## The basic HTML page

Because everything on the web is made up of HTML, we'll start there. The following code creates the simplest of web pages:

{: .window-title}
The basic HTML page

{: .tutorial-code}
>[HTML](#html)
>[JavaScript](#js)
>[CSS](#css)
{: .t-lang-selector}

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>This is Example One</head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
function initMapOne() {
    var mapDiv = document.getElementById('map_one');
    var map_one = new google.maps.Map(mapDiv);
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
#map_one {
    width: 500px;
    height: 400px;
    background-color: #CCC;
}
{% endhighlight %}

None of this is specific to Google Maps - it's the basis for any HTML page. Open your text editor and add this code, then save the file to your desktop as google-maps.html (or any other filename that ends with .html).

{: .tutorial-code}
>[HTML](#html)
>[JavaScript](#js)
>[CSS](#css)
{: .t-lang-selector}

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>This is Example Two</head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
function initMap() {
    var mapDiv = document.getElementById('map_two');
    var map_two = new google.maps.Map(mapDiv);
}

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css %}
#map_two {
    width: 500px;
    height: 400px;
    background-color: #CCC;
}
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing the initMap function needs to do is create a new Google Maps object:

## The google.maps.Map object

The first thing the initMap function needs to do is create a new Google Maps object:

{% highlight js %}

1. let minValue = UInt8.min // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8 

2. let maxValue = UInt8.max // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8

{% endhighlight %}

## The finished code

This is the final code you've put together in this lesson. It:

* Creates a div, and gives it a size. 
* Loads the Google Maps JavaScript API. 
* Creates and displays a Google Map in the div.
