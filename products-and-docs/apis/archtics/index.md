# Archtics API

Archtics Ticketing Service (ATS) API Specification
{: .lead}

## Overview
{: #overview }
API Specification for add/update and receive an Archtics account, or add a name to an existing Archtics account

## Customer Query
{: #customer-query}

**Purpose:** Customer query returns basic account and name information based on an input account-id, email address or external-id.   It can also be used to validate a customer’s pin.

**Cache:** No.

**Use:** This API call can be used to return customer (name) attributes.  There are several input parameter options:

#### NOTES:
When providing email-address:  Based on the name that is associated with the input email address, the attributes of the name returned, along with all accounts linked to the email address and certain account-level information for the main account that the name associated with the email address is primary.

When providing alternate-id:  Based on the name associated with the input external-id, the attributes of the name are returned, along with all accounts linked to the email address and certain account-level information for the account that the name associated with the email address is primary.    Note: the referenced alternate-id (name level) is not to be confused with external-id (account level)

Pin vs system account – When customer query is called with an PIN, the pin must match the pin for the name (if email or alternate-id are provided) or the primary name on the account (if account-id is provided) to successfully return.  This is intended as a means of authenticating the consumer.    

Customer query can also be called with a calling reason of 'S' (system), in which case the pin is not required.    The use case is typically a customer service application, where the calling application has other means of authenticating the consumer.

-	input = `acct_id`
    *	the attributes of the primary name are returned, along with certain account-level attributes (login attempts,rec_status,etc. ).
    *	No secondary name information is returned.
-	input = `email_address`
    * the attributes of the name associated with the email address are returned,
    * a delimited list of each account linked to the email address.
    *	certain account-level information for the account associated where the email address is primary.
-	output = `account_group`
    *	returns an array of account groups that an account belongs to
-	output = `account_id_list`
    *	This is a list of ACCOUNTS to which this NAME (email) is associated.  The first `acct_id` in that list is always the primary (main) account for that person/name/email.  The order of the remaining account ID’s is in ‘nickname’ order.
	
+	System only returns `ext_system_id_2` and `ext_system_id_1` (account-level)
+	If the input parameter includes the correct PIN, the same PIN will be returned in the output.  Otherwise, PIN is never returned in the call.

## Event Details
{: #event-details}

**Purpose:** Returns a list of events and event attributes.

**Cache:**	Yes.  Refresh 1-2 times per day (depending on expected number of event updates)

**Use:** This API call can be used to return:

1.	All events in the database
2.	A specific event or list of events.
  - `event_filter_type` : "L"
  - `event_filter` : "EVENT01,EVENT02,EVENT03" (Note: no space after the comma)
3.	A specific number of events (e.g. 45)
  - `count` : 45
4.	A specific number of events (e.g. 200) starting with a specific event (e.g. EVENT999)
  - `prev_event_name` : "EVENT999",
  - `count`: 200
5.	All events in a specific item set
  - `event_filter_type` : "S"
  - `event_filter` : "2014_Basketball"


#### NOTES:
1.	The events are returned in alphabetical order by event_name.
2.	Plan events are also included in the result set.  The event_name parameter will be the Plan Name, and the `events_in_plan` array will display all events within that plan.

### Frequency of operation:
This API call can be made 1-2 times per day, or as Archtics events are added or changed.

### Incremental or Comprehensive Data:
This API will return comprehensive data.

### Data Delivery:
  - Data content: the API will return a separate array of information for each event.
  - Approximate size of a single "record": about 750 characters per event
  - Retrieve the next "batch" of records:  use the `prev_event_name` input parameter
  - "last record" indicator: n/a
  - Request for previously received data:  n/a
  - Duplicate data: the calling system is responsible for de-duplicating data.
  - Time zone: All times are relative to the client's venue or arena.

## Event Search
{: #event-search}

**Purpose:** Returns attributes about events that occur within a specified date range.

**Cache:**	Yes.

#### NOTES:
The caller can restrict the data returned by including optional input parameters, like "end_date" and "season_name" and "num_seats", etc.  This will reduce the number of events returned in the response.

The list of classes in the "hold_classes" output array will be restricted to those Archtics classes for which the caller (uid) has privileges.

The list of classes in the "avail_classes" output array will be restricted to those Archtics classes which are available for sale.

The Archtics Sell Location Rules are not considered for this API call.

If start_date is omitted, default start_date is today's date.  If end_date is omitted, end_date is 90 days after start_date.

The system is optimized to search for specific Hold_Class values.  It is highly recommended that all calls include a valid “hold_classes” input parameter.  If the “hold_classes” parameter is not provided, the API response may be delayed by up to 2 minutes for a large database.


### Frequency of operation:
This API call can be made as needed, in accordance with the agreement between Ticketmaster and the caller.

### Incremental or Comprehensive Data:
This API will return comprehensive data.  The response data is intended to replace all previous data responses.

### Data Delivery:
  -	Data content: the API will return a separate array of information for each event that occurs within the date range specified.
  -	Approximate size of a single "array": varies from 100 to 1,000 characters
  -	Retrieve the next "batch" of records:  n/a
  -	"last record" indicator: n/a
  -	Request for previously received data:  repeat the API call
  -	Duplicate data: the calling system is responsible for de-duplicating data.
  -	Time zone: all times are relative to the client’s location.

### Error Messages:
These are no error messages that are unique to this API call.

For every block of seats sold onto the specified account at the time of the query, the following is returned: `event/section/row/first-seat/num-seats` along with associated block-level attributes such as price code, purchase price, seat status, action-ability, primary/secondary, transaction date, more…. Seat-status indicates whether the seat is available for action, has been forwarded or invited, been posted or resold, transferred to PID, etc. Action-ability determines whether the seats are enabled for printing (to TicketFast or xfer to PID), forwarding, resale, exchange etc.

In addition to block-level attributes, certain seat-level attributes are returned. These include an array of attendance indicators per block of seats (one per seat) and an array of barcodes per block. The barcodes will only be provided if the timeframe of the request is within the Tickets-ready window for the client.

Some callers do not want, or need, to see all events for an account.   They may only be interested in events in the future, events eligible for resale, etc.    Various filters are available to limit the domain of events returned, including starting-event-date, ending-event-date, based on action-ability, an enumerated list of event, and item-set based such as inet-sold, ticket-forward-events and resale-events.   These filters can be used concurrently and seats will be returned for events meeting ANY (“or” condition) of the filters specified.

Due to the potentially large datasets that can be returned, two mechanisms are provided for “chunking” the returned data.   The first is for the caller to specify the maximum number of records returned (“Count”). The second is for the caller to specify the last `event/section/row/seatblock` that was returned; the API will return the next chunk of data starting at the next record.

**Cache:**	no.

**USE:** Determine what plan, event(s), and seat locations are sold on to an account and what type of action (if any) can be taken against those seats.

#### NOTES:
  -	Pre-Defined Event Selectors;
    +	Forward = INET_FORWARD
    +	Resale = INET_RESALE
    +	Add Credit = INET_ADD_VALUE
    +	Print = INET_PRINT
    +	Club Group = INET_CLUB_GROUP
  -	Host seat sales are returned if a database table is configured properly (t_defaults; 'Seats_Sold - Host Sales Enabled' = Y.
  -	Although not required, it is highly recommended that the AM_Client_ID be included in the call.  If not, some data inconsistencies may arise.



### Frequency of operation:
This API call can be made as needed to discover seats sold to a customer account.

### Incremental or Comprehensive Data:
Comprehensive

### Data Delivery:
  -	Data content: the API will return a separate array of information for each service charge.
  -	Approximate size of a single "record": varies; an array for a typical block of 2 seats returns approximately 1,500 bytes of data.
  -	Retrieve the next "batch" of records:  n/a
  -	"last record" indicator: n/a
  -	Request for previously received data:  n/a
  -	Duplicate data: the calling system is responsible for de-duplicating data.
  -	Time zone: all time zones are relative to the client's venue.


### Error Messages:
